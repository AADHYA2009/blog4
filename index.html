    <h1>BIO</h1>
<p>Hermione is one of Harry Potter's best friends. She spends a lot of time with Harry and Ron. Her parents are Muggles (not magical) but she is the cleverest witch of her class. She was born on September 19 and when she arrived at Hogwarts for the very first time, she was almost 12. Her parents are dentists. She is intelligent and her special skill is the ability to remember all that she has read. Because of this, Hermione is successful in her tests. Although she is smart, she also is brave and has street-smarts. She cares about house-elves and has made the club S.P.E.W., the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, which Ron calls "Spew." She made scarfs and garments to liberate the elves of the slavery of the wizards. But none of the elves took the garments and Dobby (the old house elf of the Malfoy family) gathered them. She is one of the prefects of Gryffindor with Ron. Her appearance is made up of bushy brown hair, dark brown eyes, and slightly freckled skin. It is also noted at the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that she marries Ron and they have two children together called Hugo and Rose. Although in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire she was the dance partner of Viktor Krum. She belongs to Gryffindor house, which is known for bravery. The Sorting Hat thought about putting her in Ravenclaw house, which is known for wisdom, but finally it put her in Gryffindor. Hermione has a pet cat named Crookshanks, which Ron told her it was like a hairy pig.</p>
